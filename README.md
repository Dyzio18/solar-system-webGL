# Solar System - WebG

My first webGL and three.js (v89) project build with JavaScript (ES6)

## Description
It's simple model of our solar system. The size and distance of the planets is proportional. 
The Sun is smallest (to maintain readability).

**Move camera**- 
Arrow and mouse

## How build and run?
First install Node.js and npm, then: 
```
git clone https://github.com/Dyzio18/solar-system-webGL.git
npm i
npm run build
```
next, open **index.html** in your browser. 



### TODO:
- [ ] Synchronization of planet circulation and rotation
- [ ] Add asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars
- [ ] Change background to panorama [like here](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_panorama_cube)
- [ ] Upgrade description panel to show more panel about selected sphere
